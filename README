collectd2librato is a quick script for parsing RRD files from [collectd](https://collectd.org) and uploading the data to [Librato](https://librato.com).

While it's parsing and uploading, it also reads the temperatures of the CPU and hard drives.

The script requires [PyRRD](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/PyRRD/) and [rrdtool](https://www.freshports.org/databases/rrdtool/).

PyRRD can be installed with 'pip install pyrrd' and rrdtool is available in the ports tree.

Primarily, this script is only of use to FreeNAS users. Anyone else can simply install the Librato provided [collectd-librato](https://github.com/librato/collectd-librato) plugin.

Also note that as collectd runs under the main FreeNAS OS, which is not easily modified (and should not be), the easiest way to run this script is as a daemon process in a jail. The included rc script (collectd2librato) should aid in automatically starting the daemon with the jail.

The example.json file should serve as a starting point for enabling interesting RRD gauges. Be sure to adjust the hostname and any gauges that reference pool names.

Bugs, pull requests, and comments are welcome.
